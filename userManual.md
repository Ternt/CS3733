The homepage is the central hub of the website. It is mainly used for users to feel more comfortable with the website and the hospital in general. Scrolling down, you can see some extra buttons to get to different sections. For users, it is an easy way to get to different important sections in the NavBar such as the Map/Pathfinding page, and for viewing many different service requests and if you’re logged in as an admin, it allows you to view the admin page.

# NavBar

The NavBar includes links to the Map page, Service requests dropdown menu, the AI Chatbot, translation dropdown, search bar for searching for individual pages and a link to the login menu. It is an easy way for users to find essential features so that they feel more comfortable with the hospital. When the login button is pressed, you will be linked to login and when youre logged in, the button will change to a logout button. When logout is pressed, you will be directly logged out.

The “About Us” page is a link to a page with us on it and another feature.

Clicking the pencil opens up the Map Editor, where all the nodes and edges will be visible. Double-clicking anywhere generates a new node with a custom ID; clicking on a node opens up the Node Information Menu, where various properties can be changed. Clicking the “+” allows you to add a neighbor node, designated with the node ID, and clicking on a neighbor-node-chip toggles the “blocked” property of their respective edge.

Clicking on the fire icon, leads you to the heatmap. The heatmap shows for every floor how much foot traffic there is. It is currently using fake data for how hot the heat in the heatmap goes, but can be easily changed for real data that Brigham and Women’s Hospital gives it if they choose to. It can be useful for B\&W admins to see the foot traffic and maybe change the hospital in tandem of the heatmap.

For our data analytics page, we have two graphs, one for the distribution for types of service requests as shown in the Pi chart and some analytics for how many visits the webpage got every day of the week in the bar graph, while the data is not real, it can easily be used for real data gathered. Using this data, admins can find user preferences and use it to improve the website in the future.

In admin, if you and one or more other admins are on the same tab of the page, you will be able to see their cursors and what they are working on. If it is on Map Page, when someone updates the nodes or edges, it will update for all other users at the same time.

When the [?] icon in the navigation bar is clicked it will toggle an AI chatbot panel in the bottom right. The chatbot is powered by ChatGPT 3.5 turbo and will respond to messages sent to it through the text input field. As an accessibility feature, there is a microphone icon next to the send button. This will bring up a dialogue for speech recognition. The language of the speech interpreter can be changed through the language selector in the top right of the dialogue menu.

Note that the chatbot is powered by ChatGPT and while it is very good most of the time, it is not guaranteed that the results are always fully accurate.
